Basic Challenges 1
These challenges cover fundamental concepts like loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. You should already have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

Basic Challenges 2
This set of challenges builds upon the first, focusing more on iteration and slightly increasing difficulty.

High Order Array Methods
Explore high order array methods such as map, filter, reduce, and sort. Practice using these methods effectively.

Recursion
Learn about recursion and tackle challenges that involve recursive solutions.

Complexity
Delve into the theory of algorithmic complexity, including Big O notation and time/space complexity analysis.

Hash Tables, Maps & Sets
Study data structures such as hash tables, maps, and sets. Implement custom hash tables and solve related challenges.

Stacks, Queues & Linked Lists
Understand and work with data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists. Learn about fast and slow pointers.

Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees & Graphs
Explore tree and graph data structures, including binary trees, binary search trees, and graphs. Implement traversal algorithms.

Sorting Algorithms
Learn various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

Feel free to explore these challenges, improve your JavaScript skills, and deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms. Happy coding!
